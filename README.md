"Hangman Game" is a classic word-guessing game where the player's objective is to guess a hidden word. At the start of the game, a word is randomly selected from a list of available words. The player can input individual letters, attempting to guess which letters are present in the hidden word. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn on the screen. The player's goal is to guess the word before the entire hangman figure is completed, leading to a loss. The game ends either when the player successfully guesses the word or when the hangman figure is fully drawn.
